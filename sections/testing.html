        <h3 id="testing-process">Testing</h3>
        <br>
        <p>After completing my high-fidelity prototype, I conducted usability testing with 10+ participants. 
            I asked each person to complete a set of realistic scenarios, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a new medication</li>
            <li>Edit an existing medication</li>
            <li>Log a health entry</li>
            <li>Navigate back to the dashboard</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I used a think-aloud method so I could understand not just what users were doing, but what they were expecting.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Several participants struggled to move between sections. When they finished adding a medication, 
            they weren’t sure how to return to the main dashboard. Some relied on the browser back button 
            instead of the interface itself. This showed me the navigation wasn’t clear or consistent enough.
            When asked to edit a medication, multiple users tapped the medication name expecting it to open details. 
            The edit action wasn’t immediately obvious to them. They hesitated before finding the correct interaction.
            During the health logging task, a few participants paused because they weren’t sure if the fields 
            were editable or informational. The visual hierarchy made some inputs feel static.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="improvements">Improvements Made</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Based on testing, I made the following changes in the final design:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Added a clearer and more consistent navigation structure so users can easily move between Home, 
                Medications, and Health Tracking without relying on browser controls.</li>
            <li>Made medication cards fully clickable to open details, 
                aligning with what users naturally tried to do during testing.</li>
            <li>Strengthened visual cues on editable fields by refining borders, spacing, and input styling so 
                they clearly look interactive.</li>
            <li>Improved screen hierarchy to make primary actions more visually dominant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After these updates, task completion became faster and users expressed more confidence navigating the app.</p>
