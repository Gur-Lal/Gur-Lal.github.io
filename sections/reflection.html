        <p>This phase taught me how different real user behavior is from my assumptions as a designer. 
            One of the biggest challenges was realizing that what felt “obvious” to me wasn’t always 
            obvious to users. Small interaction details, like how clickable something looks, had a major impact on usability.
            I also learned the importance of designing around familiar patterns. Participants expected common mobile conventions, 
            and when those expectations weren’t met, they hesitated. Aligning my design with those mental models significantly 
            improved clarity. Most importantly, I learned that iteration is not about large redesigns, it’s about identifying 
            friction points and refining them intentionally. Testing with real users helped me make focused improvements that 
            strengthened the final experience without overcomplicating the interface.
