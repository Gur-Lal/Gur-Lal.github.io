        <h3>Thought process behind Margaret Atwood's user journey map</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The main actor of this user journey map is Margaret Atwood. I chose a very high-level scope for 
            Margaret's user journey map, since that was the most aligned with her goals. 
            It starts at Margaret's motivation in the product and ends at the user's long-term adoption of the product.  
            I took into consideration Margaret's actions, key touchpoints, 
            emotions, potential pain points, and potential solutions at each stage.

        <h3>Thought process behind Juan Diego's user journey map</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            The main actor of this user journey map is Juan Diego. I chose a lower-level scope for 
            Juan's user journey map, since he's predominantly concerned about his sporadic flare-ups. 
            It starts at Juan's concern for a symptom and ends at his response to his provider's feedback.  
            Similar to Margaret, I took into consideration Juan's actions, key touchpoints, 
            emotions, potential pain points, and potential solutions at each stage.
