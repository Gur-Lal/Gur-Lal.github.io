        <h3>Thought process behind the user journey mapping</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            I chose a very high-level scope for the user journey map. It starts at the user's motivation 
            in the product and ends at the user's long-term adoption of the product. The main actor of this 
            journey is Juan Diego. And I decided to take into consideration the user's actions, key touchpoints, 
            emotions, potential pain points, and potential solutions at each stage.
