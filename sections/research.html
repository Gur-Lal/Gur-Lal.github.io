        <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Individuals living with chronic health conditions often manage multiple medications, 
            appointments, and healthcare providers simultaneously. This creates cognitive overload, 
            increases the risk of missed doses, and makes communication with healthcare professionals fragmented.
            Many existing solutions are either too complex for older adults, lack meaningful 
            healthcare integration, or fail to provide personalized reminders and tracking. 
            Our goal is to design a mobile app that simplifies medication adherence, 
            centralizes appointment management, and enables seamless communication 
            between patients and healthcare providers.The core challenge is balancing simplicity 
            with powerful functionality, ensuring the app is accessible for elderly users while 
            still offering robust tracking and communication features.

        <h3>User Research Approach</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>1. Surveys</h4>
        <p>
            Distributed online questionnaires targeting individuals with chronic conditions 
            to understand medication routines, reminder habits, and technology comfort levels.
        </p>

        <h4>2. User Interviews</h4>
        <p>
            Conducted one-on-one interviews to explore emotional challenges, daily struggles, 
            communication gaps with doctors, and existing workaround solutions.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Secondary Research</h4>
        <p>
            Reviewed healthcare adherence studies, medication compliance statistics, and 
            analyzed competitor apps to identify usability gaps and feature opportunities.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Contextual Observation</h4>
        <p>
            Observed how users manage prescriptions at home, pill organizers, handwritten notes, 
            alarms, and family involvement.
